Questions:
1.  20 cores
2.  It roughly halves as threads double.
3.  
4.  32 threads
5.  There were more threads than cores, so it wasn't actually using 32 threads.
6.  
7.  
8.  We only used multithreading on one set of nested for loops, whereas the for loop computing pixel color is still single threaded, reducing the overall efficiency.
9.
