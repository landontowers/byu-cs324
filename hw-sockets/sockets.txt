1. socket() & connect()
2. You would have to specify a destination address each time you send data.
3. The command line arguments.
4. The port remains consistant.
5. The port changes.
6. One for all clients.
7. 3 calls.
8. 1 message.
9. 3 calls.
10. All receive operations return only one packet.
11. The original socket becomes passive, allowing a connection to be maintained. The socket returned by accept actually retrieves the data in packets.
12. The connection created by connect will be persistant, allowing the data transmitted to be more reliable.
13. The listening socket is maintaining the connection around the accept sockets, so the connection is established before any data is recieved by the accept sockets.
14. The port remains consistant.
15. The port changes.
16. One for each client. The printouts honestly seem identical, though?
17. 3 calls.
18. 1 message.
19. 1 call.
20. TCP guaruntees that the packets will arrive correctly and in order and can therefore be assembled into a single message if all the packets are recieved already.

    1. Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side;
    With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.
    Leave to thy God to order and provide;
    In ev'ry change he faithful will remain.
    Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend
    Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

    2. Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake
    To guide the future as he has the past.
    Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
    All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
    Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know
    His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.

    3. Be still, my soul: The hour is hast'ning on
    When we shall be forever with the Lord,
    When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
    Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
    Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,
    All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

26. If no messages are available at the socket, the receive calls wait for a message to arrive, unless the socket is nonblocking, in which case the value -1 is returned.
27. If a message is too long to fit  in the supplied buffer, excess bytes may be discarded depending on the type of socket the message is received from.
28. When the packet is smaller than the passed buffer, only that much data is returned.
